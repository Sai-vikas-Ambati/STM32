# STM32 Codes

This repository contains a collection of STM32 codes that I have **practised and implemented** while learning embedded systems programming.  
Each folder/code focuses on a specific concept such as GPIO, ADC, interrupts, and SysTick timers.

## 📂 Contents

1. **Blinking_LED** – Basic LED blinking using GPIO.  
2. **Blinking_2LED** – Controlling two LEDs with GPIO.  
3. **2LED_2Switch** – Two LEDs controlled by two switches.  
4. **Blinking_LED_using_Switch** – LED blinking controlled through a switch.  
5. **ADC_LED_maneuver** – LED controlled using ADC values.  
6. **ADC_Switch_LED_maneuver** – LED behavior controlled by both ADC and switch inputs.  
7. **Blinking_2LED_using_Interrupt** – Two LEDs controlled using external interrupts.  
8. **LED_Switch_Interrupt_ADC_maneuver** – Combination of LED, switch, interrupt, and ADC.  
9. **SysTick_without_interrupt** – Delay using SysTick without interrupts.  
10. **SysTick_with_Interrupt_2secDelay** – SysTick timer with interrupts to generate a 2-second delay.

## 🛠 Notes
- These codes are for **learning and practice purposes only**.  
- Tested on STM32 development boards using **STM32CubeIDE**.  
- Not optimized for production — mainly to understand the basics of STM32 peripherals.
